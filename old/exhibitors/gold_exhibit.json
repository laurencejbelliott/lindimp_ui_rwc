  "description": "This gold neck torc and bracelet were found at Sudbrook and Baumber respectively, and represent the growing wealth of certain individuals in late Bronze Age Lincolnshire. They were both made between 900 and 700 BC, though it is not known where they were made, or what the source of the gold was. In both cases, the gold content is very high, though it is alloyed with silver and copper.",
